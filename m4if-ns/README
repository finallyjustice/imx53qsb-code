This is the bare metal program running on i.MX53 QSB to test the M4IF.

Unless we comment the following code, we would not be able to read secure data in normal world.

*R32 M4IF_WMIS0   = 0x80000000;  // enable secure memory

If you want to use your own mkimage in your u-boot code, please change MKIMAGE in Makefile.
